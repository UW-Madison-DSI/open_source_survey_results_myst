# 2024 UW‚ÄìMadison Open Source Program Office Survey

In Spring 2024, the [Open Source Program Office at UW‚ÄìMadison](https://ospo.wisc.edu/) conducted a survey to:  

- Assess the use of open source tools across the university community  
- Identify open source projects currently under development  
- Gather feedback on strengthening the open source ecosystem at UW‚ÄìMadison  

This repository hosts a [MyST site](https://mystmd.org) that summarizes and presents results from the survey.
