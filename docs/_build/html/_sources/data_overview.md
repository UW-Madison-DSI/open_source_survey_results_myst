| Open-ended Feedback | 72.4% | Voluntary responses |

### Response Quality Indicators

- **Average completion time**: 18.3 minutes
- **Straight-line responses**: < 2.1%

## Data Processing Pipeline

Our data processing followed established best practices:

1. **Raw Data Collection**: Qualtrics survey platform
2. **Initial Validation**: Automated completeness and format checks  
3. **Data Cleaning**: Removal of test responses and duplicates
4. **Anonymization**: PII removal and response ID generation
5. **Quality Assessment**: Manual review of flagged responses
6. **Final Dataset**: 1,247 validated responses

```{admonition} Privacy Protection
:class: important
All personally identifiable information was removed during data processing. Geographic data was aggregated to country/region level to protect participant privacy while preserving analytical value.
```

## Missing Data Patterns

Analysis of missing data reveals non-random patterns that inform our analytical approach:

- **Contribution questions**: Higher non-response among beginners
- **Tool-specific usage**: Missing data correlates with experience level
- **Open-ended responses**: Completion varies by survey section

### Handling Strategy

We employ multiple approaches for missing data:

- **Complete case analysis** for core demographic comparisons
- **Multiple imputation** for tool usage patterns  
- **Sensitivity analysis** to assess impact of missing data assumptions

## Data Limitations

```{admonition} Important Limitations
:class: warning

- **Sampling bias**: Self-selected participants may not represent all open source users
- **Language barrier**: Survey conducted in English only
- **Platform bias**: Recruitment primarily through GitHub, Twitter, and academic networks
- **Temporal scope**: Snapshot of usage patterns in Spring 2024
```

Understanding these limitations is crucial for proper interpretation of results and generalizability of findings.
