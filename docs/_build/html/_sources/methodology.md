# Survey Methodology

This section details the research design, data collection procedures, and analytical methods used in the Open Source Survey 2024.

## Research Design

### Objectives

Our survey aimed to address three primary research questions:

1. **Usage Patterns**: How do different communities use open source software?
2. **Adoption Drivers**: What factors influence tool selection and adoption?
3. **Contribution Behavior**: How do users engage with open source projects?

### Survey Framework

We developed a comprehensive survey instrument based on:

- Literature review of open source adoption studies
- Stakeholder interviews with community leaders
- Pilot testing with 47 participants
- Expert review by methodology specialists

```{admonition} Theoretical Foundation
:class: note
Our approach builds on the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and Innovation Diffusion Theory to understand adoption patterns and user behavior in open source contexts.

## Data Processing & Analysis

### Data Cleaning Pipeline

```{myst-md}
1. **Initial Validation**
   - Response completeness checks
   - Format validation (emails, dates, etc.)
   - Range checks for numerical inputs

2. **Quality Screening**  
   - Duplicate detection and removal
   - Straight-line response identification
   - Logical consistency validation

3. **Standardization**
   - Text field normalization
   - Category consolidation  
   - Missing data coding

4. **Anonymization**
   - PII removal
   - Geographic aggregation
   - Response ID generation
```

### Statistical Methods

#### Descriptive Analysis
- Frequency distributions and cross-tabulations
- Summary statistics with confidence intervals  
- Geographic and demographic breakdowns

#### Inferential Statistics
- Chi-square tests for categorical associations
- ANOVA for group comparisons
- Logistic regression for binary outcomes
- Principal component analysis for dimensionality reduction

#### Qualitative Analysis  
- Thematic analysis of open-ended responses
- Inductive coding with inter-rater reliability
- Integration with quantitative findings

### Software & Tools

**Data Processing**: Python (pandas, numpy)  
**Statistical Analysis**: R (tidyverse, survey packages)  
**Visualization**: matplotlib, ggplot2, Plotly  
**Text Analysis**: NLTK, spaCy, tidytext  
**Survey Platform**: Qualtrics XM

## Ethical Considerations

### IRB Approval

This research was reviewed and approved by the UW-Madison Institutional Review Board (IRB Protocol #2024-0243).

### Informed Consent

All participants provided informed consent through:

- **Sharing Guidelines**: Only aggregated, anonymized results published
```

## Limitations & Validity

### Internal Validity

**Strengths**:
- Pilot testing reduced measurement error
- Multiple validation checks ensure data quality
- Standardized instruments enable comparison

**Limitations**:  
- Self-report bias in usage frequency estimates
- Social desirability bias in contribution reporting
- Survey fatigue in longer sections

### External Validity

**Generalizability Considerations**:
- Sampling bias toward technically sophisticated users
- English-language limitation reduces global representation  
- Platform recruitment bias (GitHub, Twitter users)
- Temporal limitations (Spring 2024 snapshot)

### Construct Validity

Validated through:
- Expert review of survey instruments
- Factor analysis of multi-item scales
- Comparison with established metrics from prior studies
- Pilot testing with target population
