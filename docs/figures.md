- **AI/ML tool adoption** shows exponential growth since 2020
- **Container technology** adoption follows a classic S-curve pattern

### Satisfaction vs. Adoption Rate

```{figure} _static/satisfaction_adoption.png
:name: satisfaction-adoption  
:width: 100%

Scatter plot comparing user satisfaction ratings with adoption rates for popular open source tools. Tools in the upper right quadrant represent the "sweet spot" of high satisfaction and broad adoption.
```

**Quadrant Analysis**:

::::{tab-set}
:::{tab-item} High Satisfaction, High Adoption
:sync: hs-ha

**"Established Winners"**
- Git (94.2% adoption, 4.6/5 satisfaction)
- Python (78.4% adoption, 4.3/5 satisfaction)  
- VS Code (71.6% adoption, 4.2/5 satisfaction)
- Docker (58.4% adoption, 4.0/5 satisfaction)

*These tools have achieved widespread adoption while maintaining high user satisfaction.*
:::

:::{tab-item} High Satisfaction, Low Adoption
:sync: hs-la

**"Hidden Gems"**
- Rust (12.3% adoption, 4.4/5 satisfaction)
- Svelte (8.7% adoption, 4.2/5 satisfaction)
- Julia (6.9% adoption, 4.1/5 satisfaction)
- Nix (4.2% adoption, 4.3/5 satisfaction)

*These tools have passionate user bases but haven't achieved mainstream adoption.*
:::

:::{tab-item} Low Satisfaction, High Adoption  
:sync: ls-ha

**"Necessary Evils"**
- Jenkins (34.7% adoption, 2.8/5 satisfaction)
- Maven (28.9% adoption, 2.9/5 satisfaction)
- Webpack (31.2% adoption, 3.0/5 satisfaction)
