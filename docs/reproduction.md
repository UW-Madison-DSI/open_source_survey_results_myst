title: "Reproducing the Survey"
---


Both the 2024 `r uni_name` open source survey and this MyST analysis are open source. Instructions for customizing and reproducing this analysis are included here for ease of use.

This project was inspired by [a needs assessment survey](https://github.com/ds3-nyu/Needs-Assessment-Survey) conducted by the [NYU Data Science and Software Services](https://cds.nyu.edu/ds3/) (DS3), an open source survey which was reproduced at the University of Washington.

## About the Survey

The 2024 open source survey at `r uni_name` was administered with Qualtrics. Both the [.qsf file](https://github.com/UW-Madison-DSI/open_source_survey_results/blob/main/Open_Source_Program_Office_Survey.qsf) for the survey and [an example CSV](https://github.com/UW-Madison-DSI/open_source_survey_results/blob/main/data/survey_data.csv) of anonymized survey response data are available in this project's GitHub repo.

### Exporting Survey Data From Qualtrics
Once your survey period is over, you can easily export your survey data. Within the Qualtrics project site for your survey, navigate to "Data and Analysis" $\rightarrow$ "Export & Import" $\rightarrow$ "Export Data..." and use the default settings in the options menu ("Download all fields" and "Use choice text") to export the survey response data as a CSV file.


### Customizing the Site Theming

Most universities have a brand guidelines webpage that provides the color hex codes and typefaces that conform with the university's brand identity. [`custom.scss`](https://github.com/UW-Madison-DSI/open_source_survey_results/blob/main/custom.scss) contains the [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) that styles all elements of the site that are not plots generated by R. You can customize the theme of the Quarto site here using your institutional brand's colors and typefaces. Custom fonts can be imported directly from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) in `custom.scss` or downloaded and installed locally.

[`setup.py`](https://github.com/UW-Madison-DSI/open_source_survey_results_myst/blob/main/setup.py) is an R script that loads necessary packages and handles theming of R code output, like plots. Customize the sections of this script that define variables for your institution's name and color palette. The .qmd files that make up this Quarto site each `source` this file, so color variables, names, and plot themes customized in `setup.R` will apply to R output throughout the site.

Some R chunks in the site qmd files, such as in `usage.qmd`, also contain vectors that you can edit to remove unwanted words or characters from free response field analyses or to highlight certain elements of plots.
